LEGACY SYSTEMS SUMMARY
================================================================================

Total Legacy OS Systems: 27 (9.2% of fleet)

Operating Systems in Use:
  - Windows 7 Professional   (7 systems)
  - Windows 7 Enterprise     (8 systems)
  - Windows 8.1 Professional (6 systems)
  - Windows 8.1 Enterprise   (6 systems)

Distribution by Site:
  HQ:         9 legacy systems
  Dallas:     7 legacy systems
  Malibu:     1 legacy system
  Nagasaki:   5 legacy systems
  Amsterdam:  5 legacy systems

Departments with Legacy Systems:
  - Engineering (all sites)
  - Engineering Development (all sites)
  - QA (all sites)
  - Development (Malibu only)

Use Cases:
  1. Hardware compatibility testing
  2. Legacy industrial control systems
  3. Specialized CAD/CAM software
  4. Embedded systems development
  5. Security vulnerability research

Security Controls:
  ✓ Network isolation (dedicated VLANs)
  ✓ No internet connectivity
  ✓ Enhanced monitoring and logging
  ✓ Scheduled for replacement/upgrade
  ✓ Compensating security controls in place

Upgrade Schedule:
  - Q1 2025: Critical systems (Windows 7)
  - Q2 2025: Remaining Windows 7/8.1 systems
  - Target: 100% modern OS by mid-2025


================================================================================
DUAL NIC SYSTEMS SUMMARY
================================================================================

Total Dual NIC Systems: 15 (5.1% of fleet)

Distribution by Site:
  HQ:         5 dual-NIC systems
  Dallas:     3 dual-NIC systems
  Malibu:     1 dual-NIC system
  Nagasaki:   2 dual-NIC systems
  Amsterdam:  4 dual-NIC systems

Technical Departments Only:
  - Engineering
  - Engineering Development
  - QA
  - Development

Network Configuration:
  Primary NIC:   Production/Development Network
  Secondary NIC: Management/Storage Network OR Isolated Test Network

Use Cases:
  1. Network segmentation (production vs. development)
  2. High availability (redundant paths)
  3. iSCSI/SAN dedicated storage network
  4. Out-of-band management network
  5. Multi-homed security testing

MAC Address Pairs:
  - Both NICs use manufacturer-specific OUI
  - Both registered in DNS/DHCP
  - VLAN tagging properly configured
  - Routing controls prevent network bridging

Special Considerations:
  ⚠ Requires detailed network documentation
  ⚠ Firewall rules for both interfaces
  ⚠ Monitoring on both network segments
  ⚠ Proper VLAN configuration critical
  ⚠ Prevent unintended routing between networks


================================================================================
